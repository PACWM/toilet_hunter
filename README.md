# ðŸš½ Toilet Hunter: The Last Dash

## Overview
**Toilet Hunter: The Last Dash** is a frantic, comedic action game where you must dash to the restroom before your bladder meter overflows! Dodge obstacles, manage your speed, and reach the toilet in under 60 seconds.

---

## How to Play

- **Move**: Use A/D or arrow keys to run left and right.
- **Jump**: Press Space or your jump key to leap over obstacles.
- **Dash**: Use the dash key (Shift or custom) for a burst of speed (with cooldown).
- **Goal**: Reach the toilet before your bladder fills up or time runs out!

## Core Mechanics

- **Bladder Meter**: Fills automatically over 60 seconds. If it reaches 100%, you lose!
- **Obstacles**: Bananas, shopping carts, and toddlers slow you down or knock you back.
- **Dash**: Temporarily increases your speed, but has a cooldown.
- **Win/Lose**: Reach the toilet to win. If your bladder meter fills or time runs out, you lose.
